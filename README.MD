## Developing

There's a few ways you can test. Since this is intended for Wallpaper Engine:

- Download as zip (Green 'Code' button above).

- Inside Wallpaper Engine, choose a testing monitor, and click the Editor button at the top.
- Click, Create Wallpaper, and for some reason it'll ask for a folder.
  - Find the directory where you downloaded/cloned this folder at.
- At the top right next to File, click Edit and `Open in Explorer`.
  - MAKE CHANGES TO THIS NEW FOLDER.
  - Open up your text editor to this new location that should resemble '\wallpaper_engine\projects\myprojects\'.
    - Saving any changes made here will be reloaded automatically in the Wallpaper Editor.
    - Changes made in the original folder will not be reflected.

### To test project.json changes: 

- Go to File -> Apply as Wallpaper.
- Inside Wallpaper UI, it should appear as a new "Installed" wallpaper with the settings updated.
