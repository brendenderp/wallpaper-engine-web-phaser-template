## Developing

There's a few ways you can test. Since this is intended for Wallpaper Engine:
    
  -  Download as zip 
  
    If using GIT;  inside terminal, pick a location to clone to
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/teachtyler/wallpaper-engine-web-template.git web-template
    ```
    
  - Inside wallpaper engine, choose a monitor, and click the Editor button at the top
  - Click, Create Wallpaper, and find directory where you downloaded/cloned this folder at
  - It should appear inside the Wallpaper Editor
  - Right click the thumbnail tile, `Open in Explorer`
    - MAKE CHANGES TO THIS NEW FOLDER, saving any changes made will be reloaded automatically in the Wallpaper Editor
    - Changes made in the original folder will not be reflected in the Wallpaper Editor
    - The original folder location will not be updated (until further updates from the developer) 
    
    
 ####  To test project.json changes: 

  - Go to File -> Apply as Wallpaper
  - Inside Wallpaper UI, it should appear as a new "Installed" wallpaper with the Settings updated.
